# Reimagine classical 

[Reimagine classical](https://aliceohio.github.io/reimagine.classical/) is a site for people who are interested in classical music but who may have never found the right music to fit their personal musical taste. 

Remembering the days of music recordings being available on vinyl, then the transition to tape cassettes, then on to cds and now to the multiple music apps where one can listen to everything, sometimes the choices are overwhelming.

As a classical music lover and musician I get frustrated by poor performances and I've yet to find an online music app that offers consistent good recordings from top-notch musicians. 

When you think of Debussy or Mozart you don't want to hear just anyone perform. What is it that makes a recording great as compared to just okay? It's about the performer's intimate knowledge of the piece they are performing, the hours of practice, the life experiences conveyed through the music. Music is not just about listening but about feeling. You should be able to feel the emotion of the musician coming through when you are listening (think of a live concert by your favorite artist vs an instrumental version you might hear in the elevator - one will definitely put you to sleep!)

My goal through this website is to create a service in which I help you to experience the same passion I have for classical music by creating a specific collection of classical pieces based on your current listening preferences. By asking a few questions initially, and through our contact after you fill out the "let's talk" form, I will take time to curate your individualized playlist.

### Unfixed Bugs

Using only CSS and HTML limits the number of music styles in the Let's Talk Page without affecting User Experience. Additionally, I am limited to how the checkbox and label wrap using only CSS and HTML (i.e. not wrapping together because the code doesn't see the checkbox and its corresponding label as one unit). I limited the number of styles (initially there were 8) due to problems with UX and wrapping, but the checkbox is still not linked to the label at certain screen sizes.

Additionally, due to the limitations of HTML and CSS, I created a custom thank you form.

- I am very thankful to my mentor, who provided me not only with many online resources to ensure accessibility and accuracy in my code, but also gave me additinal hints and tips for refinement. Thanks Gareth!
